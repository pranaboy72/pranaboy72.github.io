M.S. student @ Yonsei University.

I am currently a M.S. student at [Machine Learning and Control Systems Lab (MLCS)](https://mlcs.yonsei.ac.kr/) at Yonsei University, advised by [Prof. Jongeun Choi](https://mlcs.yonsei.ac.kr/Professor.html). My research interests lie in Robotics and Machine Learning, with a particular focus on leveraging diffusion models and geometric deep learning in robot learning. 

I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Yonsei University.
